Week 4 Lab
REMEMBER
A script should run without errors.
It should perform the task for which it is intended.
Program logic is clearly defined and apparent.
A script does not do unnecessary work.
Scripts should be reusable.

Notes

The positional parameters are the words following the name of a shell script. They are put into the variables $1, $2, $3 and so on. As long as needed, variables are added to an internal array. $# holds the total number of parameters
The echo command can be used to print strings or variables to the screen, or to a file
The $USER variable and $HOME variable are special - print them out and see what they are
RECAP: Bash IF statements:

The syntax of an if statement is always

if [ condition ]; then
  #do something
else
  #do something
fi
for example, to test if a the variable val  is greater that 100

if [ $val -gt 100 ]; then
  echo "Value too large".
else
  echo "The value is ok"
fi

Write a script to make a backup directory called backup located in the github directory under week4. 
If this script runs a second time it causes an error - what is the problem? 

We would like to be able to run the script in the following way


[epa@localhost week4]$ ./script.sh /usr/include/ backupdir

Here, there are 2 positional parameters (in bold) supplied, the name of the source directory and the name of the destination directory,

Revise the script to accept a parameter that allows the user to backup the contents from any directory to any directory but don't do any copying yet.
Revise the script to check to make sure that 2 positional parameters are supplied. If 2 positional parameters are not supplied, the scripts issues a usage warning and exists
Revise the script should check to see if the destination directory exists, if it does not, the script should create the directory (see IF statements above and moodle page on IF statements).
Revise the script to use tar -cvf to create a backup of the source directory and store the backup in the backup directory. Try the script on /usr/include/
Bonus Question: Revise the script so that the name of the backup file has a date/time stamp eg, the filename is backup-2017-10-03.tar.gz Check the man pages on date to find out more
